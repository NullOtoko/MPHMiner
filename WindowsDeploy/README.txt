If you wish to GPU mine only, rename Start-GPU.bat to Start.bat (remove or rename the default Start.bat as it CPU mines as well)


Disclaimer: This is a minor fork of the default MultiPoolMiner_3.0.1 release. It includes the following changes:

1. Locale has been set to US instead of EU by default.
2. I have added myself to the donate function.
3. This version only uses MiningPoolHub, as this pool supports payout in Monero as well as bitcoin (and many other cryptos of the users choosing).
4. The deploy files have been created for those that want the miner to run on startup (for dedicated mining rigs).
5. If deploy files are used, please follow the instructions here as well. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/technet-magazine/ee872306(v=msdn.10)
